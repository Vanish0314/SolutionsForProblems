# Mexification

**Time Limit:** 2 seconds
**Memory Limit:** 256 megabytes

## Problem Statement

You are given an array $a$ of size $n$ and an integer $k$. You do the following procedure $k$ times: 

 •  For each element $a_i$, you set $a_i$ to $\operatorname{mex}$$^{\text{∗}}$$(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},a_{i+2}, \ldots,a_n)$. In other words, you set $a_i$ to the $\operatorname{mex}$ of all other elements in the array.  

Please find the sum of elements in the array after all $k$ operations. 

$^{\text{∗}}$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $x$ which does not occur in the collection $d$.

## Input Format

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$) – the number of elements in $a$ and the number of operations done.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq n$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

## Output Format

For each test case, output the sum of elements after all $k$ operations on a new line.

## Sample Tests

**Output:**

## Note

In the first test case, we performed the operation on the array $[0,2,1]$ three times. Let's compute the result after the first time: 

 •  The first element becomes $\operatorname{MEX}(2,1)=0$ 
•  The second element becomes $\operatorname{MEX}(0,1)=2$ 
•  The third element becomes $\operatorname{MEX}(0,2)=1$ 

So, after the first operation, $[0,2,1]$ becomes $[0,2,1]$ again. It can be shown that the array will not change no matter how many times we perform the operation, so the final array after three operations is still $[0,2,1]$. The sum is $0+2+1=3$.

In the third test case, the array becomes $[2,2,2,2]$.
